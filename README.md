The Extended Kalman Filter proved to not work when noise is significantly increased and the Particle Filter is tricky to implement.
Therefore I came up with a simple KF algorithm currently used only for predicting heading and distance, 
which proved to be the best solution to successfully cover the grading up to Part 5.
Please see the FinalProjectQuestions pdf for further details.
